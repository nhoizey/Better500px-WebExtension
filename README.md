# Better500px

This is an extension for Firefox, Chrome and Opera that enhances [500px.com](https://500px.com/) with a few useful shortcuts for better navigation:

- "Pulse" item in the menu that links to the search for current photographer, sorted by pulse
- "Favorites" item in the menu that links directly to the favorites, if such a gallery exists and contains at least one photo

This extension is built using [the WebExtensions standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions), sharing the exact same source code for Firefox and Chrome.

The Chrome (and Opera) extension is built using [@oncletom](https://github.com/oncletom)'s [crx](https://github.com/oncletom/crx) Node.js command line app.
